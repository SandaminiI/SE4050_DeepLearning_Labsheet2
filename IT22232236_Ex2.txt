1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

For very few nodes (1–2), the model underfits and accuracy is low.
Increasing hidden nodes improves accuracy as the model captures more complex decision boundaries.
Too many nodes (e.g., 50) can cause overfitting, where training accuracy is high but test accuracy may not improve.

2. Pattern of accuracy when hidden nodes increase:

Accuracy increases quickly from very small hidden sizes (1–5).
After a certain point, improvement slows down.
Very large hidden layers can cause unstable decision boundaries and overfitting, reducing generalization performance.
